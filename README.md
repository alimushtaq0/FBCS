# Feedback & Control Systems Project

Designed and implemented a compensator for a satellite attitude control system using MATLAB. Analyzed system stability and performance through root locus and Bode plot methods. Achieved design targets for overshoot, rise time, settling time, and steady-state error by applying lead compensation. Enhanced control system robustness and ensured precise pitch angle tracking in closed-loop configuration.
